# EIGA Development Workflow

## Before coding

- read CLAUDE.md
- check relevant `.claude/rules/`
- inspect current implementation
- identify the smallest coherent slice
- define how success will be verified

## During coding

- keep domain logic independent of UI
- prefer small components and pure functions
- preserve accessibility
- avoid speculative abstractions
- do not introduce dependencies without a concrete reason

## Before commit

- review the diff
- run lint
- run type checking
- run tests if present
- run a production build when appropriate
- run `/eiga-ship-check` for meaningful milestones

## Git discipline

Use focused commits. Prefer commit messages such as:

- `feat: add local letterboxd import`
- `feat: render director relationships`
- `fix: preserve graph focus during search`
- `refactor: isolate graph construction`
- `docs: define visual direction`

Never commit secrets, `.env` files, generated build output, or personal imported media exports.
